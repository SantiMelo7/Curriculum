        <p className="content">
          I am a Frontend Developer, with 1 year of experience. I use <span>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</span> as the main technologies,
          and I use <span>React and Next.js </span> as frameworks and I take it to the next level with <span>Typescript</span>, I also like to use  <span>Tailwind (CSS framework)</span>,
          in which I consider that the designs go up a level and I consider that it makes it much easier to manage styles and efficiently.
          As for databases, <span>MongoDB</span> will be used, as well as Postman to test the endpoints and in general I have used
          <span> (Material Ui, Boostrap, Exprees, Styled-Componets, Axios, React-Router-Dom)</span>, these as technologies that add a lot to the projects.
          I have experience in managing versions <span>(Git and GitHub)</span> as well as deploying to <span>Vercel and Netifly</span>.
          Currently I am still looking to learn more technologies, to be able to have broader knowledge, although I consider that I handle what I have already learned in a good way and I am always willing to learn more.</p>
